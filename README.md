 + Exploration and Analysis : Here I explored the data is every which way I could, making sure to take notes and relationships that exists with each entity. 
 + Putting it all together : This is the creative part of my project, where I used clean and simple designs and visualization to present the outcome of my Analysis through building an interactive dashboard that shows all the important metrics.
