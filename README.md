## Objective
 In this project, all I wanted to achieve is to show the loans that was allocated to different African nations, which sector it was allocated to and the project it was invested in,  granularity. While showing the Chinese.
 
 ## Project Flow
 + Data collection : This is quite a very simple and easily available data collected from kaggle.com
 + Data Preparation : The source data is all cleaned up. All I had to do is to perform some transformations like Promoting the first row to Header, and changing some of the columns to the correct Data types.
 + Exploration and Analysis : Here I explored the data is every which way I could, making sure to take notes and relationships that exists with each entity. 
 + Putting it all together : This is the creative part of my project, where I used clean and simple designs and visualization to present the outcome of my Analysis through building an interactive dashboard that shows all the important metrics.
